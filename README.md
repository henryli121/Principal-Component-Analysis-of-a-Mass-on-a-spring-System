# Principal-Component-Analysis-of-a-Mass-on-a-spring-System
This project uses Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to track the motion of a mass on a spring with varying levels of disturbances. The study demonstrates the utility of PCA in analyzing complex systems and provides practical applications for low-rank approximation using Singular Value Decomposition (SVD).
